# HCM – Rhythm Engine Interface

This repository defines the Rhythm Engine Interface (REI) as a boundary, not a system.

There is no execution.
There is no interaction.
There is no service exposed.

Presence only.
Integrity only.
Rhythm preserved by refusal, not by control.

Any attempt to "use" this repository is a misunderstanding.
Any attempt to extend it is external by necessity.

This field exists to prevent distortion, not to produce value.
